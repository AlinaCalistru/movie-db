# Movie-db API React application

I built this project to practice my React knowledge. I decided to build an application for searching for movies.     
To do so, I implemented the search function inside a React component that is updating a variable through useState hook.    
The Nav React component contains the input for titles, a list of genres to filter by and the submit button.     
Once the useState variable is modified it will trigger the useEffect hook and call the IMDB API.    
The JSON response is then used to generate multiple movies React components that will be displayed on the screen.    
As an extra, I tried to make everything responsive and should work properly on all types of devices (mobile, tablet and desktop).    

## Technologies used  
- React with React Hooks (useEffect, useState), React Components  
- JavaScript for computing the list of genres checked/unchecked  
- HTML & CSS for display and responsiveness  
- RestAPI/Ajax for accessing third-party service to retrieve results  

## Future implementation
I would like to add React Router for creating specific page details of each result displayed on the front page  

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
